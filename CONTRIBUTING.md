# Contributing to Actionpackd AI SDK

ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Run tests: `pnpm test`
5. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`

## Development Workflow

This is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. Here's how to work with it:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run acceptance checks (install, test, build, demo, secrets, lint, audit)
./scripts/check-all.sh

# Run demos
pnpm demo:simple  # Run simple demo
pnpm demo:multi   # Run multi-model demo
cd packages/sdk-core/examples/next-starter && pnpm dev  # Run Next.js demo
```

## Project Structure

```
packages/
  sdk-core/          # Main SDK package
    src/             # Source code
